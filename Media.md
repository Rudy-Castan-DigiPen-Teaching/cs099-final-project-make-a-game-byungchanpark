**License

Option 1) Non-Commercial
If you are't using the music in a commercial project, or monetizing, the music is free to use. However:

- If you are uploading to youtube or facebook, you wont be able to use their monetization features to
 run ads on your videos.
- A note about "copyright music" may appear in your login, but this is NOT a "copyright strike". 
You can still use the music free, and your account will have no negative impact. 
This notice is there to protect our music.
- An advert may or may not appear sometimes before your video.

If you can, I also ask that you please help me in return with a few easy steps! subscribe to our YouTube
 Channel to help us in return! It also helps us a lot if you credit. In turn, we can tweet a thank you with 
mention to your name (Please see "how to credit" question below). Lastly, donating not required, but 
always appreciated :)

Here you’ll find music and soundscapes (looping and non-looping) for your horror games,

All are free to use in MP3 format with attribution.

In order to use my work legally, you are required to credit me in your actual game, video, interactive novel, podcast, etc. Crediting me on the info page on Youtube, Google Play, etc. instead of in the actual video, game, novel, etc. is not sufficient. (The reason is that people often don’t read the information section.)
